      </ul>
      <h2>ARTICLE 2 – PURPOSE</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of these General Terms and Conditions is to define the
        conditions in which the Service is provided and made available to Users
        and the rights and obligations of the Parties arising from.
      </p>
      <h2>ARTICLE 3 – DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICE</h2>
      <p>
        The Service allows the User to use the VOIP OUT function by purchasing
        Minutes Packs. The various VOIP OUT calling options and the
        corresponding commercial terms and conditions are described on the
        Portal and on the Application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the countries where the Service is available, all or part
        of the above-mentioned functionality may or may not be provided.
        Accordingly, the User is invited to refer to the Portal or to the
        Application before ordering the Product, to verify the exact scope of
        performance offered for each country.
      </p>
      <p>
        DehayMobile reserves the right to amend or withdraw its offer. The User
        therefore understands and acknowledges that the list of countries from
        where a VOIP OUT call is made, is likely to evolve over time.
        DehayMobile will inform the User, whenever possible, that the Service is
        not available for a specific country before ordering the Product. If the
        Service becomes unavailable for a particular country after an order,
        DehayMobile will offer a refund or an equivalent service.
      </p>
      <p>
        DehayMobile reserves the right to refuse and/or block any User’s order
        that seems irregular (in particular regarding the quantity of minutes
        ordered).
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, VOIP OUT calls to special or premium rate numbers are not
        allowed and will not be routed through the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service is being regularly updated. Thus, the Application downloaded
        by a User may only be valid for a limited time, in view of these updates
        and any technical, legislative or regulatory changes that may compel
        DehayMobile to publish a new version of its Application.
      </p>
      <h2>ARTICLE 4 – ACCESS TO THE SERVICE</h2>
      <p>
        To use the Service, the User shall have an active mobile number with a
        Mobile Operator, an access to the Internet and mobile network as well as
        computing equipment and specific software.
      </p>
      <p>
        The User therefore acknowledges the access to the Service may be
        affected by the performance of any of these elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The minimum requirements to use the Service are specified on the Portal,
        and by the Google (Android, Google Play) and Apple (iOS, App Store)
        operating systems distributing the Application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The User acknowledges and accepts that such systems requirements, which
        may change from time to time, are his/her sole responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of the Service involves data transmission from and to the User's
        Terminal, operations that may be charged for the use of data flows. The
        User is then strongly encouraged to consult the applicable rates of
        his/her Mobile Operator prior using the Service, to ensure that any data
        consumption through the Service is not incompatible with a reasonable
        use of his Terminal. Libon cannot be held liable for excessive data
        consumption with respect to the terms of access to the Internet network
        as they have been agreed between the User and his/her Mobile Operator.
      </p>
      <p>
        The User acknowledges that using the Service outside Canada and the USA
        is likely to result in prices that are significantly higher than the
        normal price. It is the User’s sole responsibility to enquire and to pay
        the roaming costs and other applicable charges imposed by the Mobile
        operator. In addition, within the North America Economic Area, the
        Mobile operator could set a threshold of reasonable use beyond which
        web-browsing may be charged by the Mobile operator, with additional fees
        compared to the national tariff. To the extent that this consequence
        would limit the use of the Service, DehayMobile shall under no
        circumstances be held liable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Use of the Service implies creating an account and purchasing
        Minutes Pack on the Portal or on the Application.
      </p>
      <h3>4.1 Creating an Account</h3>
      <p>
        To access and fully use the Service, the User shall register from the
        Application – which may be freely downloaded (excluding any potential
        connexion fees) on Google Play or App Store, by fulfilling the required
        information to the creation of his/her Account (with his/her mobile
        phone number and a personal code sent by Libon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating the account is only possible from the Application, which shall
        be installed on the User’s Terminal.
      </p>
      <p>
        To order Minute Packs from the Portal, the Customer must log in
        according to the procedure indicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The User undertakes to ensure that the information provided during
        his/her registration is reliable and in accordance with reality and is
        permanently updated. Assuming that false, inaccurate or incomplete
        information is provided by the User, DehayMobile shall be entitled to
        delete the Account and terminate these General Terms and Conditions
        without delay.
      </p>
      <p>
        DehayMobile guarantees the confidentiality of the data collected when
        creating the Account.
      </p>
      <p>The User is responsible for the use of his Account.</p>
      <h3>4.2 Placing an order</h3>
      <p>
        The User may familiarize itself with the various Products offered for
        sale by DehayMobile on the Portal or on the Application, without being
        obliged to place an order.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Calling plans offered for sale by DehayMobile are those displayed on
        the Portal and on the Application the day they are consulted by the
        User, allowing the User to access the Service for one or several
        countries included on the list of countries allowing VOIP Out calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content (length, destination and so on) of the Minutes Packs and
        their terms of use are detailed within the Application and on the
        Portal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calling Plans are invoiced to the User at the current price as
        communicated to the User prior to placing his order. Prices are quoted
        in USD, all taxes included, or in the currency which has been notified
        to the User prior to the confirmation of his order.
      </p>
      <p>
        DehayMobile reserves the right to modify its prices at any time on the
        Portal or on the Application. Minutes Packs are invoiced on the basis of
        the current prices at the time of validation of the order by the User.
      </p>
      <p>
        The User can purchase Products directly on (i) the Application by
        logging into his Account or (ii) on the Portal, providing his telephone
        number and following the specified procedure (indicating on the Portal
        the SMS code sent by DehayMobile).
      </p>
      <h3>4.2.1 Purchase of Minutes Packs on the Portal</h3>
      <p>
        The User selects the Product he is interested in and is then redirected
        to the login page. The User shall indicate his phone number, on which a
        code will be sent by SMS. The User shall then enter the code sent in the
        box provided for this purpose. If the identification sequence is
        successful, the User is then returned to the final payment step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the User is identified, a detailed summary of the User’s order
        appears, specifying the nature, quantity, destination and price of the
        Product selected by the User.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the User has taken note of this information, the User may confirm
        his order by proceeding to the payment. Payment will be made, unless the
        server is unavailable, immediately on the Internet by credit card. Most
        international credit and debit cards, including Visa and Mastercard, are
        accepted by DehayMobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is specified that for greater simplicity, the User may, if he/she so
        wishes, register the 16 numbers of the credit card used as well as its
        expiry date on the Portal and on the Application in relation to his/her
        Account. The backup, processing and confidentiality of this data will be
        carried out by Braintree, a subcontractor of DehayMobile. These data
        will under no circumstances be used for purposes other than those
        referred to herein, namely the payment of the User's order.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the ordering process, the User acknowledges having read
        and accepted the General Terms and Conditions by checking the box
        provided to that end. Then, the User definitively confirms his/her order
        by clicking on the "Confirm payment” box. Such confirmation of the order
        implies the User unconditionally acceptance of the General Terms and
        Conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as the User confirms the payment of his order by credit card and
        the payment is accepted, the order is confirmed and becomes irrevocable
        (the order will be saved on the computer records of Libon, which are
        kept on a reliable and sustainable media, and shall be considered as a
        proof of the contractual relations between the Parties). A confirmation
        message (SMS) will then be sent to the User, summarizing information
        about his/her order.
      </p>
      <p>
        DehayMobile reserves in any event the right to refuse any order or
        delivery in the event of (i) any dispute pending with the User; (ii)
        total or partial non-payment of a previous order placed by the User;
        (iii) refusal to authorize payment by credit card from banking
        institutions; (iv) non-payment or partial payment of the order. Libon
        may therefore not be held liable under any circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Products purchased whose payment has been validated are immediately
        made available to the User.
      </p>
      <p>
        The User is however reminded that, pursuant to Canadian Consumer Code,
        the right of withdrawal may not be exercised, inter alia, to (i) service
        contracts fully performed before the end of the withdrawal period ; or
        to (ii) contracts providing dematerialised digital content whose
        performance has begun after User’s prior express agreement and after an
        express waiver of his/her right of withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pursuant to this article, the User acknowledges that he expressly waives
        his right of withdrawal from the moment all or part of Product is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms of withdrawal are also detailed on the Portal within the
        section "How do I seek a refund of my purchase of minutes?”
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Product has not been started to be used and if the User has sent
        his withdrawal form/request to DehayMobile within above-mentioned time
        limit granted, the User will be refunded within 14 calendar days
        following the date on which DehayMobile became aware of the User's
        exercise of the right of withdrawal, on the same means of payment as the
        one used for the purchase.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2.2 Purchase of Minutes and Calling plans on the Application</h3>
      <p>
        Once the Application is downloaded on the Terminal and the Account is
        created, the User may buy Minutes Packs directly on the Application
        through an In App Purchase or a “purchase through the Application", by
        entering his password or by using biometric authentication (fingerprint,
        Touch ID or address ID). Any purchase through the Application requires
        prior acceptance by the User of the general terms and conditions of the
        marketplace used (Google Play or the App Store).
      </p>
      <p>
        The User selects the product he is interested in and shall indicate his
        Apple or Google Play user information and his password, or biometric
        authentication. If the identification is successful, the purchase is
        complete, and the User is invoiced according to the general terms and
        conditions of the marketplace used.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the User wishes to exercise his right of withdrawal from the
        Application, the User shall refer to the dedicated sections edited by
        Google Play and App Store, which recommend, according to the general
        terms and conditions currently in force, to follow the instructions
        defined below. However, due to regular updates of these general terms
        and conditions, the User shall regularly check on the above-mentioned
        marketplaces website.
      </p>
      <h4>On iPhone/iOS:</h4>
      <p>
        If the User has purchased a Minutes or Calling plan with his Apple ID,
        and has not waived his legal right of withdrawal by starting to use the
        content of the Minutes Pack, a withdrawal form shall be sent to Apple
        Distribution International; or the User shall:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to the page "report a problem";</li>
        <li>Indicate his/her Apple ID;</li>
        <li>Select "purchase history";</li>
        <li>Select the relevant purchase and click on "report a problem";</li>
        <li>Mention his/her willingness to withdraw.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>On Android:</h4>
      <p>
        If the User has purchased a Minutes or Calling plan through Google Play,
        and has not exercised his/her right of withdrawal by using the content
        of the Minutes Pack, a withdrawal form shall be sent to Google Trade
        Limited; or the User shall:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to play.google.com</li>
        <li>Click on “order history”;</li>
        <li>Select the relevant purchase;</li>
        <li>Click on “more details”;</li>
        <li>
          Select "Request a refund” or “Report a problem”, and then choose the
          option that matches the current situation;
        </li>
        <li>Complete the form and indicate the refund request.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The User may also request a refund by going to "Get a refund on Google
        Play" page and follow the detailed instructions under the section "Apps,
        games, & in-app purchases (including subscriptions)".
      </p>
      <h2>ARTICLE 5 – LIABILITY AND GUARANTEES OF THE USER</h2>
      <p>
        The User shall be careful, cautious and shall demonstrate awareness
        about the information available and/or sent. Using the Service, the User
        should refrain from attempting to mislead third parties by usurping the
        name or the corporate name of other persons and more particularly by
        claiming to be an employee of Libon. The User undertakes to alert Libon
        to any unauthorized use of his/her Account, or any other breach of the
        security of the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The User agrees to only use the Service for lawful purposes and in
        accordance with the applicable legislation, and recognizes that it is
        forbidden to communicate or forward illegal content through this
        Service, failing which the User would be prosecuted and held liable to
        legal proceedings (civil and/or criminal).
      </p>
      <p>
        The User undertakes to use the Service in accordance with the purpose
        for which it has been defined and marketed. The User also undertakes not
        to use the Service in a way which would be contrary to its purposes or
        these General Terms and Conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, the following shall be considered as inappropriate use of
        the Service giving rise to suspension and/or termination of the Account,
        under the conditions of Article 2 below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          use of communications for non-personal purposes (in particular for
          business purposes);
        </li>
        <li>use of the Service for illegal or malicious purposes;</li>
        <li>

      <h2>ARTICLE 6 – LIABILITY AND GUARANTEES OF DehayMobile Inc</h2>
      <p>
        DehayMobile undertakes to deliver a free of any third-party rights’
        Product to the User, whose characteristics (quantity, duration, and
        destination) are compliant with the User’s order. If DehayMobile fails
        to properly deliver, the User shall be entitled to request the enforced
        execution of the sale or its rescission according to article 1017 of the
        Canadian Civil Code.
      </p>
      <p>
        DehayMobile undertakes to develop capacities for the Service to be
        perfectly working and to take the necessary measures to ensure the
        Service’s continuity and quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case of the Application and/or the Service malfunction preventing the
        normal use of the Product purchased, the User may (i) send a refund
        request to Apple Store or Google Play according to the conditions laid
        down to that end, or (ii) send a request by E -mail to
        support@dehaymobile.com or contact Libon on Facebook or WhatsApp.
      </p>
      <p>
        DehayMobile, as well as the members of its staff, respect the secrecy of
        Users’ correspondence. Secrecy covers entirely the correspondence’s
        content and the correspondents’ identity.
      </p>

      <h3>6.1 Limits of liability</h3>
      <p>
        DehayMobile does not guarantee, under no circumstances, that the Service
        or the Application are error-free or suited for the specific needs of
        the User.
      </p>
      <p>
        DehayMobile is bound by a best-efforts obligation during each stage to
        access the Portal or the Application, including consulting, identifying,
        purchasing, payment or any other potential service available on the
        Portal or the Application.
      </p>
      <p>
        DehayMobile may not be held liable in the event that User's data and/or
        messages contain illegal content and/or infringe the rights of a third
        party.
      </p>
      <p>
        DehayMobile may not be held liable for the consequences resulting from
        the unauthorized access by a third party to a User’s Account because of
        the negligence of the latter. The User shall immediately warn
        DehayMobile of any unauthorized use of his/her account or any security
        breach regarding his account.
      </p>

      <h3>6.2 Specific limits to emergency calls</h3>
      <p>
        “Emergency Calls” refer to calls made to hospitals, police services,
        medical care units or other services which allow connection to an
        emergency service.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is acknowledged that the VOIP OUT function of the DehayMobile
        Application does not replace the mobile telephony service provided by
        the User’s Mobile Operator.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make an Emergency Call, the User will be redirected to the telephony
        service of his/her Mobile Operator. The User is asked to close the
        Application so as to directly dial the emergency number through his/her
        Mobile Operator’s Network. The Application does not allow the User to
        make an Emergency Call.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the transmission and routing of Emergency Calls is not carried out
        by the Service, DehayMobile may not be held liable if these Emergency
        Calls are unsuccessful, in particular if the Emergency Calls cannot be
        routed by the Mobile Operator for technical reasons and/or because of
        the geographical situation of the User.
      </p>

      <h3>7.1 Suspension & Termination of the General Terms and Conditions</h3>

        <li>The contact details, in particular the address of the User as communicated by the latter, do
            not reflect the reality;</li>
        <li>In the case of a payment incident or of a suspected fraud regarding the payment, including
            cases where DehayMobile knows or has serious reasons to believe that the amount
            corresponding to the minutes ordered by the User through a payment mechanism has not
            actually been debited from the User's Account;</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>7.2 Deactivation of the Account at the initiative of the User</h3>

      <p>
        The User shall not transfer to a third party any of the rights or obligations held under these General

        Account. Besides, the User shall be held liable for the content or any other data available online or
        sent from his/her Account.
      </p>
